Subject: fix: mark PipeWire capturer as failed after session is closed

After a PipeWire screencast session is successfully started, the
consumer is expected to keep calling CaptureFrame() from the
DesktopCapturer interface in a loop to pull frames. A PipeWire
screencast session can be closed by the server on user action. Once the
session is closed, there's no point in calling CaptureFrame() again as
the capture has to be restarted. Inform the caller of the failure by
returning Result::ERROR_PERMANENT on the next invocation of
CaptureFrame().
